# Welcome to my vue projects

A couple of days back, I decided to level up my frontend skills by learning Vue. I wanted to add another tool to my toolkit 🧰
I spent some days learning the basics. You can see the details about my daily learning on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/danylaws/status/1676179173625192449).

Now, it is the right moment to make more complicated projects, to put into practice all I've learned so far. Here you'll find all the projects I will build along the way.

Each project will have its dedicated branch. If you are a Vue newbie like me, feel free to learn with me! Just clone the desired branch and explore! Any suggestion or question is welcome!

Now, let's build 🏗️⚒️🧱🔥

  <summary><b>PROJECT 1: Todo App</b></summary>
    The first project I will build is a simple to-do app. Here is a non-exhaustive list of specifications  :
    
    -  A todo has an id, a title, and a status (done or not)
    -  A todo should have a category
    -  I can create, edit, or delete a todo or a category
    -  I can toggle a todo for done to undone and vice versa. Each state should have its visual appearance;
    -  If I delete a category, the system should delete all the todos of this category

I want to keep it simple here. No database or API call is involved in this first project. I will use an array to store the data. 

You are free to add more specifications to make it as challenging as you want! ☺️☺️💪
