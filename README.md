# Welcome to my vue projects

A couple of days back, I decided to level up my frontend skills by learning Vue. I wanted to add another tool to my toolkit 🧰
I spent some days learning the basics. You can see the details about my daily learning on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/danylaws/status/1676179173625192449).

Now, it is the right moment to make more complicated projects, to put into practice all I've learned so far. Here you'll find all the projects I will build along the way.

Each project will have its dedicated branch. If you are a Vue newbie like me, feel free to learn with me! Just clone the desired branch and explore! Any suggestion or question is welcome!

Now, let's build 🏗️⚒️🧱🔥
